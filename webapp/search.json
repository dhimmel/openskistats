    "text": "Skiers and riders, you‚Äôve all seen these trail maps ‚Äî they‚Äôre essential for navigating the mountain, finding the fastest lift, or planning your next run. \n\n\n\n\nThis map, painted by the legendary James Niehues, shows the South Face of Big Sky, Montana, üá∫üá∏.\n\n\n\n\nBut have you ever wondered how common south-facing slopes are? In other words, do most ski trails in this hemisphere favor southern aspects, or are they more often found on the north side of the mountain? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe began our journey to answer this question by gathering data from OpenSkiMap, which refines¬†OpenStreetMap¬†to create an amazing interactive visualization of the world and all its ski trails. \n\n\n\n\nFor decades, thousands of OpenStreetMap contributors have worked to annotate ski areas and their trails. In the Upper Valley region of Vermont and New Hampshire, ‚Ä¶ \n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¶ you can see the iconic Killington and its neighbor Pico. \n\n\n\n\nHere is a local favorite, Whaleback Mountain. \n\n\n\n\nAnd just north of it is Storrs Hill, where you can ski for free this season! \n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing this data, we can see how north-facing each ski area is by looking at its ‚Äúski rose‚Äù. \n\n\n\n\nTake, for example, the Dartmouth Skiway in Lyme, NH. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the two signature sides of the Skiway, Holt‚Äôs Ledge and Winslow Ledge. \n\n\n\n\nOn powder days, you can ski from Winslow across the Grafton Turnpike and glide right to the bottom of Holt‚Äôs Ledge Double. \n\n\n\n\nIf we:\n\ngather the coordinates for all trail segments\nconnect the dots\ntreat each of these segments as a vector\nscale the vectors by their vertical drops\n\nwe can summarize them in a ‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¶ ski rose! Similar to how wind roses chart wind direction for location, ski roses characterize the directions of all trail segments at a ski area. \n\n\n\n\nEach petal of the circular chart represents a compass direction, with its radius proportional to the combined vertical of trail segments in that direction. Highlighted is the Northwest by West petal‚Ä¶ \n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¶ to which these particular segments contribute.\n \n\n\n\n\nAnd here‚Äôs the North North East petal.\n While these NNE segments appear similar in horizontal distance to the NWbW segments above, their greater steepness results in greater vertical drop, and hence the largest petal of the rose.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can do this for other ski areas too!\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are 48 more ski roses randomly selected from the US. Have you been to any of these? Did you remember facing north while skiing down? \n\n\n\n\nAnd here are the ski roses for 37 US states with at least one ski area. Do most states look north-facing to you? And, as an aside, can you tell which state has the most combined vertical? \n\n\n\n\nOur analysis of the orientation of all ski areas across the globe revealed a strong poleward and moderate eastward preference. In other words, the majority of runs in the northern hemisphere are oriented toward the north and east, while those in the southern hemisphere are oriented toward the south and east. \n\n\n\n\nThis trend reflects which aspects maximize snow retention by minimizing sun exposure and preferring morning sun ‚Äî when temperatures are lower ‚Äî to afternoon sun. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to trail bearings, we have published data on other key metrics of a ski area like total vertical, number of lifts, and peak elevation for ski areas across the world.\nIn OpenSkiStats.org/ski-areas, you can search for your favorite ski area and explore all of its summary statistics. Whether you‚Äôre planning your next powder day or just marveling at the hidden patterns of the slopes, this may be a fresh way to see the mountains you love.\nFor example, below are the statistics of the five New Hampshire/Vermont mountains we saw earlier:\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nWe hope this data inspires your winter adventures, helps you assess the climate resilience of distant ski mountains, or simply gives you a moment to pause and smell the roses.\nCurious to learn more?

    "text": "Introduction\nThere are an estimated 135 million alpine skiers worldwide, resulting in 350-380 million visits to ski areas per year [1]. Mountain tourism is estimated to drive up to 16% of international tourist arrivals worldwide (~375 million in 2019) [2]. In the United States, outdoor recreation accounted for 2.3% of the gross domestic product in 2023 by adding $639.5 billion in value to the economy. $3.9 billion directly [3]\nIn the United States, outdoor recreation generated $1.2 trillion in economic output or 2.3% of the gross domestic product in 2023 [3, Table 10]. $3.9 billion in value added is directly [3, Table 2]\n\nExisting scholarly literature related to downhill skiing is limited and primarily focuses on economics [4], health impacts, avalanche science [5], environmental sustainability [6,7,8], the threat from climate change [9,10,11,12,13], or ski trail routing algorithms [14,15]. We present one of the first scholarly accounts of the spatial metrics of ski areas on a global scale.\nAn open and global database and analysis of ski areas will help inform skiers, while providing insights to industry stakeholders. There are a variety of existing resources that compile information of ski areas. Both OnTheSnow and OpenSnow contain a global database of ski areas and metrics, with a focus on snow and weather conditions. However, neither makes their source code or data openly available. Stuart Winchester maintains several manually curated tables of ski areas, which are discussed in articles on the Storm Skiing Journal and Podcast. Laurent Vanat reports on aggregate ski areas metrics in his annual International Report on Snow & Mountain Tourism. Other resources focus on specific regions including New England Ski History, Wikipedia‚Äôs Comparison of North American ski resorts, and Vertical Feet. Other resources focus primarily on ski lifts, including Liftie (open source) and Lift Blog. Skimap.org compiles official trial maps produced by ski areas.\nHere we base our analysis on OpenStreetMap and OpenSkiMap.\nOpenStreetMap is a collaborative map of the world available under an open license. Since its launch in 20024, geospatial data has been continuously contributed by a global community of volunteers and companies [16]. The platform‚Äôs crowdsourced nature ensures frequent updates and granular detail, with contributors adding information on features such as roads, buildings, natural landscapes, and, crucially for this study, ski areas and their trials and lifts. Individual users often contribute to specific domains. For example, study author Daniel Himmelstein previously helped complete and align the Long Trail, a long-distance hiking trail in Vermont [17]. Meanwhile, the company Amazon contributed missing roads, driveways, and vehicle routing restrictions to aid in their delivery operations. This mosaic of interests has resulted in an exceptionally broad and diverse collection of volunteered geographic information, albeit with varying levels of detail by region. This breadth along with OpenStreetMap‚Äôs open license and availability have made it an invaluable tool for extracting and analyzing spatial data across a range of scientific disciplines [18].\nOpenStreetMap provides its own general purpose frontend to view a rendered maps of the world. Specialized frontends have arisen to refine, analyze, and render maps for particular applications. Examples include OpenRailwayMap for railroads, OpenCycleMap for bicycling, Waymarked Trails for hiking routes, OpenSeaMap for seafaring and nautical pursuits, Wheelmap for wheelchair accessibility, and Open Infrastructure Map for electrical and telecommunication transmission. OpenSnowMap and OpenSkiMap display both nordic and alpine skiing information.\nOpenSkiMap refines data from OpenStreetMap along with Skimap.org to create an interactive map of the world that highlights ski areas, runs, and lifts along with associated metadata like run difficulty. OpenSkiMap is created and maintained by Russell Porter, with much of its code openly available. OpenSkiMap releases refined datasets of ski areas, runs, and lifts as GeoJSON downloads that update daily. Since OpenStreetMap does not include granular elevation data, OpenSkiMap incorporates the USGS Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation data. \nThe founding motivation of this study was to examine trends in ski trail orientations. The orientation of a ski trail is a major influencer of sunlight exposure. On a local level, orientation affects weather patterns and climate, although in less generalizable ways than it does sunlight. We were unable to find a systematic analysis of or database containing ski trial orientations. In 2006, Alpine Zone Forum user Jonni compiled a manual and qualitative list of the primary orientation for 37 ski areas in Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire. Hence, we set out to create a global, continuously updating, open, and accessible resource for browsing ski areas and their orientations.\nA second motivation was Geoff Boeing‚Äôs analysis ‚Äî first by blog and later publication [19] ‚Äî of city street orientations from OpenStreetMap. Boeing tabulated street segments by their orientation into polar histograms (i.e.¬†roses) to show whether a city‚Äôs roads were neatly arranged into a grid like Manhattan or a spaghetti mess like Boston. Boeing released the modular code underlying his analysis in the osmnx Python package [20,21], which we use sometimes directly and other times as a reference. Boeing‚Äôs street roses take inspiration from wind roses, which summarize the direction of wind [22]. Wind roses themselves take inspiration from the compass rose, an ancient visualization steeped in tradition and symbolism [23,24]."

    "text": "Data completeness\n\nNumber of Ski Areas\nOpenSkiMap contained 11,810 ski areas with 6,796 of those assigned a downhill usage.\nLaurent Vanat‚Äôs 2022 International Report on Snow & Mountain Tourism compiled primarily national level data to report on global ski area metrics [1]. Vanat identified 5,764 ski areas worldwide, when limiting to ‚Äúequipped outdoor ski areas covered with snow‚Äù, which excludes ‚Äúindoor facilities, mountaineering-only areas, and other types of facilities such as dry slopes.‚Äù The 1,945 ski areas with 5 or more lifts qualified as a ski resort, of which 52 were deemed as major based on a threshold of ‚Äú1 million skier visits per winter season‚Äù. OpenSkiMap contained 5,020 operating downhill ski areas with one or more lifts (i.e.¬†equipped) and 1,611 with 5 or more lifts. This equates to 87% and 83% of Vanat‚Äôs respective counts. Vanat identified ‚Äú68 countries offering equipped outdoor ski areas covered with snow‚Äù compared to 22 in our analysis.\nStuart Winchester identified 505 active ski areas in the United States as of 2023 [25]. Winchester required ski areas to have one or more lifts, a snow surface, operated for at least 1 day in the last season, excluding areas operating solely for personal use. OpenSkiMap contains 519 downhill, equipped, operating ski areas in the United States.\nWe observe a striking difference in the amount of skiing infrastructure between the northern and southern hemispheres. The northern hemisphere is home to 42 times the combined vertical drop, 43 times the number of runs, 45 times the number of lifts, and 63 times the number of ski areas than the southern hemisphere.\nSkiing is further concentrated in the northern hemisphere within a narrow latitude band (Figure¬†4 (b)). 73.6% of the world‚Äôs skiable vert is located between 40‚Äì50¬∞N and 43.8% is between 45‚Äì58¬∞N."

Les Trois Vall√©es of France is the largest ski area in the world. The Dartmouth Skiway of the United States shows a bimodal distribution due to its two peaks. Killington Resort is primarily east facing with a slight northern preference due to the direction of the spine of the Green Mountain. At Mt. Bachelor, one can ski a stratovolcano where beginner terrain is primarily northeast facing, while the advanced terrain is primarily northwest facing. The authors joke that should someone be a fast learner, they could stay in the sun all day at Mt. Bachelor by starting in the beginner eastern terrain in the morning and progressing to the advanced western terrain in the afternoon. Olos Ski Resort of Finland is the darkest ski resort in the world due to its 67.9¬∞N latitude, north-facing orientation, and sloping terrain as calculated by our solar irradiation estimator. Etna Sud Nicolosi of Italy is the sunniest ski resort in the world due to its 37.7¬∞N latitude and south-facing orientation. Jackson Hole is the the most southward (i.e.¬†equatorward) facing ski resort in the United States with over 12,000 m in total skiable vert. Narvikfjellet of Norway is the northernmost ski resort (‚â• 5 lifts) in the world at 68.4¬∞N, while Cerro Castor of Argentina is the southernmost at 54.7¬∞S. Notice how the sun‚Äôs path changes by hemisphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: Ski roses by hemisphere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: Ski roses for US states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The eye of skiing: A 2-dimensional polar histogram showing skiable vert by orientation (angular coordinate) and absolute latitude (radial coordinate). Orientations for ski run segments in the southern hemisphere undergo a hemispherical flip, such that a due west bearing remains due west, while a due south bearing becomes due north. Hence, orientation axis labels use the terms poleward and equatorward. Each 2D histogram bin‚Äôs fill color represents enrichment of observed combined skiable vert over an equal distribution of orientation within an absolute latitude band. Several processing steps help highlight the trends in the data: latitude bands without at least XX in combined vert are removed; a uniform prior is applied to orientations; and extreme enrichment values are clipped. Ski runs closer to the equator demonstrate a greater northeast preference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Skiable vert by latitude: The histogram shows the combined skiable vert across all ski run segments for each absolute latitude bin, split by hemisphere. Downhill skiing is remarkably concentrated in both the northern hemisphere and around 45 degrees north!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Latitude insights of ski runs and their association with orientation.\n\n\n\nDeduplication of effort: OpenStreetMap used by Strava, mapy.cz, mapbox, komoot, REGRID etc. Single place to curate the world‚Äôs ski areas\nWe extract all segments comprising ski runs\nOrientation versus aspect\nAspect applies to polygons and lines. Most polygon runs also have a line run Orientation only applies to lines In the absence of trees, aspect would be a better indicator of sun exposure. However, with shading of trees, orientation could be a better indicator of sun exposure Weighting by vertical drop along a segment, likely brings orientation closer to aspect under the assumption that steeper trails are more likely to descend along the fall line. Orientation was more readily available because it just requires the coordinates of the run (latitude, longitude, elevation), which OpenSkiMap includes, and does not require computation on adjacent terrain. Ski trails that traverse the fall line are often graded, would the resolution of aspect measurements be sufficient Orientation might be more relevant for skiers ???\nWeighting segments by vertical drop. Downhill skiing is the art of descent.

Yet, it is undeniable that conditions and logistics make a big impact on the experience. Furthermore, each day skiing represents a large investment in terms of time and the cost of lift tickets, gear, and travel. Accordingly, OpenSkiStats serves the large contingent of savvy skiers who seek exhaustive metrics into ski areas. Such skiers meld observations on their own experiences with the data-driven insights provided by OpenSkiStats to create mental models on what factors of a ski area matter most to them and how these factors interact with conditions in search of the ultimate experience.\nOpen infrastructure for skiing.

All downhill ski runs in the world tabulated by their difficulty and the locale specific coloring convention. This figure serves as a legend for the three main coloring conventions for ski run difficulty. For example, an intermediate run is colored blue in North America, while it is colored red in Europe and Japan. This visualization helps answer a practical question: if you happened to be transported to the top a random ski run anywhere in the world, both what difficulty level can you expect and what color would the trail signage use to indicate the difficulty?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) All difficulty levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Condensed difficulty levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7: Distribution of slope by run difficulty. See OpenStreetMap piste:difficulty key.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunlight\nSolar irradiance is computed at the level of a run segment, as defined by its latitude, longitude, elevation, bearing, and slope. The segment is treated as a plane, analogous to a solar panel allowing us to use the pvlib photovoltaic modeling library for these calculations [26]. The Ineichen and Perez model with Linke turbidity estimates diffuse normal irradiance, global horizontal irradiance, and direct horizontal irradiance, under the assumption of a clear sky. We compute irradiance at 15 minute intervals for the duration of a typical 120 day ski season ‚Äî December 1 to March 31 in the northern hemisphere and May 31 to September 28 in the southern hemisphere for the 2024 ski season. We average the irradiance over the ski season to compute solar irradiation in kilowatt-hours per square meter per day (kW/m¬≤/day) along the segment. When averaging irradiation across segments, like when aggregating to the level of a run or ski area, we weight by the vertical drop of the segment.\nSome shortcomings of these estimates are that they do not account for cloud cover, shadowing due to vegetation, and shadowing due to topography both on a micro (fine topographic variation like boulders, cliffs, moguls, etcetera) and macro scale (higher terrain like ridges or summits that block sunlight). We specify a surface type of snow in pvlib, which sets an albedo of 65%, i.e.¬†snow reflects 65% of incoming light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†8: The effect of slope, latitude, and orientation on solar irradiance. Polar plots show how solar irradiance varies for a hypothetical ski run segment by its orientation (angular coordinate) and its slope (top row radial coordinate) or latitude (bottom row radial coordinate). The first column estimates solar irradiance at 09:00 on the winter solstice. The second column estimates solar irradiance at 15:30 on March 31, closing day of a typical 120 day ski season. The third column shows the average solar irradiation over the entire season. Fixed geographic inputs ‚Äî latitude, longitude, and elevation ‚Äî correspond to those of the Dartmouth Skiway in New Hampshire, USA. For the latitude-varying plots, a fixed slope of 15¬∞ is used. The latitude-varying plots illustrate the effect of non-linear turbidity variation by latitude. The radial coordinate spans the complete theoretical range from 0‚Äì90¬∞ (only showing the northern hemisphere in the case of latitude), even though skiing rarely occurs on sustained slopes exceeding 35¬∞ and outside of the 30‚Äì70¬∞N latitude band."

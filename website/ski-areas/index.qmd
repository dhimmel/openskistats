Explore statistics on all named ski areas in the world with at least 3 runs and 50 meters of cumulative vertical drop across their runs.
The underlying data is provided by [OpenSkiMap](https://openskimap.org) and [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) with statistics computed by <https://github.com/dhimmel/openskistats>.

### Table usage

Numeric columns support the filtering filters:

- `15` for value ≥ 15
- `-20` for value ≤ 20
- `[10, 20]` for 10 ≤ value ≤ 20
- `(10, 20)` for 10 < value < 20
- `(, 5]` for value ≤ 5
- `80` (not 0.8) for a percent value ≥ 80%.


### Source data 

```{python}
from IPython.display import Markdown
from openskistats.openskimap_utils import load_openskimap_download_info

info = load_openskimap_download_info()["ski_areas"]
date_str = info.last_modified.split("T")[0]
Markdown(f"OpenSkiMap data is from {date_str}.")
```

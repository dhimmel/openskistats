Skiers and riders, you’ve all seen these trail maps—they're essential for navigating the mountain, finding the fastest lift, or planning your next epic run. @cr-southface

In particular, this map, beautifully painted by the legendary [James Niehues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Niehues), is of the <span style="color: #FF8C42;">**South Face**</span> of Big Sky, Montana.

But have you ever wondered how common south-facing slopes are? In other words, do most ski trails in this hemisphere favor <span style="color: #FF8C42;">**southern**</span> exposure, or are they more often found on the <span style="color: #36B37E;">**north**</span> side of the mountain?

We began our journey to answer this question by gathering data from [OpenSkiMap](https://openskimap.org/), which refines [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) 
to create an amazing interactive visualization of the world and all its ski trails.

Thousands of OpenStreetMap contributors have worked for decades to annotate ski areas and their trails.<br><br>
In this New Hampshire/Vermont region, ...

Here is a local favorite, Whaleback Mountain.

Analyzing this data, we could see how much *north-facing* each ski area is by looking at its "ski rose".

Take, for example, Dartmouth Skiway in Lyme, NH.

These are the two signature sides of the Skiway, <span style="color: #FF8C42;">**Holt's Ledge**</span> and <span style="color: #36B37E;">**Winslow Ledge**</span>.

On powder days, from <span style="color: #36B37E;">Winslow</span>, you can ski across the road

If we:

- gather the coordinates for all trail segments,
- connect the dots,
- treat each of these segments as a <span style="color: #f07178;">vector</span>, and
- scale the vectors by their <span style="color: #FFC857;">vertical drops</span>,

we can summarize them in a ...

<div style="--cr-narrative-sidebar-width: 3fr;">

... <span style="color: #f07178;">**ski rose**</span>!<br><br>
Similar to how [wind roses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_rose) chart wind speed and direction at a location, ski roses characterize the directions of all trail segments at a ski area.

Each *spoke* of the circular chart represents a compass direction, with its length proportional to the <span style="color: #FFC857;">**total length**</span> and <span style="color: #36B37E;">**vertical drop**</span> of trail segments in that direction.<br><br>
Highlighted is the <span style="color: #f07178;">**Northwest by West**</span> spoke...

And here's the <span style="color: #f07178;">**North North East**</span> spoke.<br><br>
While these NNE segments may seem small, their verticals contribute to a significantly larger spoke in the rose compared to others.

Here are 48 more roses.
What do you think?
Do most of them look north-facing to you?

Our analysis of the slopes of *all* ski areas across the globe revealed a clear <span style="color: #36B37E;">poleward</span> and slight <span style="color: #FFC857;">eastward</span> bias.<br><br>
In other words, the majority of slopes in the <span style="color: #36B37E;">northern</span> hemisphere oriented toward the <span style="color: #36B37E;">north</span> and <span style="color: #FFC857;">east</span>,
while those in the <span style="color: #36B37E;">southern</span> hemisphere are oriented toward the <span style="color: #36B37E;">south</span> and <span style="color: #FFC857;">east</span>.
[@cr-hemisphere]{scale-by="0.8"}

This trend likely reflects the desire to maximize <span style="color: #36B37E;">snow retention</span> and minimize <span style="color: #FFC857;">sun exposure</span>, ensuring better skiing conditions and longer seasons.

In addition to trail bearings, we have published data on other key metrics of a ski area like <span style="color: #FFC857;">**total verts**</span>, <span style="color: #36B37E;">**number of lifts**</span>, and <span style="color: #FF8C42;"> **peak elevations**</span> for ski areas across the world.

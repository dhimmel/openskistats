Skiers and riders, youâ€™ve all seen these trail maps â€”
they're essential for navigating the mountain, finding the fastest lift, or planning your next run.
@cr-southface

This map,
painted by the legendary [James Niehues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Niehues),
shows the [**South Face**]{style="color: #FFC857;"} of Big Sky, Montana, ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.

But have you ever wondered how common south-facing slopes are?
In other words, do most ski trails in this hemisphere favor [**southern**]{style="color: #FFC857;"} aspects,
or are they more often found on the [**north**]{style="color: #36B37E;"} side of the mountain?

We began our journey to answer this question by gathering data from [OpenSkiMap](https://openskimap.org/), 
which refinesÂ [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)Â to create an amazing interactive visualization of the world and all its ski trails.

Here is a [local favorite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VbO4ZXTM4o "Mountains Not for Profit: short documentary by Teton Gravity Research in collaboration with the Indy Pass on four non-profit ski areas: Shames Mountain, Whaleback, Black Mountain of Maine, and Antelope Butte."), Whaleback Mountain.

And just north of it is Storrs Hill, where you can [ski for free](https://www.powder.com/news/free-skiing-new-hampshire-ski-area "Lift Tix Are Now Free All Season Long at New Hampshire Ski Area") this season!

Analyzing this data, we can see how *north-facing* each ski area is by looking at its "ski rose".

Take, for example, the Dartmouth Skiway in Lyme, NH.

These are the two signature sides of the Skiway, [**Holt's Ledge**]{style="color: #FF8C42;"} and [**Winslow Ledge**]{style="color: #36B37E;"}.

On powder days,
you can ski from [**Winslow**]{style="color: #36B37E;"} across the Grafton Turnpike and glide right to the bottom of [**Holt's**]{style="color: #FF8C42;"} Ledge Double.

- scale the vectors by their [vertical drops]{style="color: #FF8C42;"}

Similar to how [wind roses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_rose) chart wind direction for location,
ski roses characterize the directions of all trail segments at a ski area.

Each *spoke* of the circular chart represents a compass direction,
with its radius proportional to the [combined vertical]{style="color: #FF8C42;"} of trail segments in that direction.<br><br>

And here's the [**North North East**]{style="color: #f07178;"} spoke.<br><br>
While these NNE segments appear similar in horizontal distance to the NWbW segments above, their greater steepness results in greater vertical drop, and hence the largest spoke of the rose.

Here are 48 more roses in the US (randomly selected among other short-named ones).
Have you been to any of these?
Did you remember facing north while skiing down?

And here are the [ski roses]{style="color: #f07178;"} for 37 US states with at least one ski area.

And do most states look north-facing to you?

Our analysis of the orientation of *all* ski areas across the globe revealed a strong [poleward]{style="color: #36B37E;"} and moderate [eastward]{style="color: #FF8C42;"} preference.<br><br>
In other words, the majority of runs in the [northern]{style="color: #36B37E;"} hemisphere are oriented toward the [north]{style="color: #36B37E;"} and [east]{style="color: #FF8C42;"},
while those in the [southern]{style="color: #36B37E;"} hemisphere are oriented toward the [south]{style="color: #36B37E;"}.
[@cr-hemisphere]{scale-by="0.8"}

This trend reflects which aspects maximize [snow retention]{style="color: #36B37E;"} by minimizing [sun exposure]{style="color: #FFC857;"} and preferring morning sun --- when temperatures are lower --- to afternoon sun.

In addition to trail bearings, we have published data on other key metrics of a ski area like [**total vertical**]{style="color: #FF8C42;"}, [**number of lifts**]{style="color: #36B37E;"}, and [**peak elevation**]{style="color: #FFC857;"} for ski areas across the world.
<br><br>
In [OpenSkiStats.org/ski-areas](/ski-areas), you can search for your favorite ski area and explore all of its summary statistics.
<br><br>
We hope this data will be used to guide winter adventures, assess the climate resilience of distant ski mountains, or to just give you a minute to stop and "smell" the [roses]{style="color: #f07178;"}.

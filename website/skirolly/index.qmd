Skiers and riders, you’ve all seen these trail maps—they're essential for navigating the mountain, finding the fastest lift, or planning your next epic run.
@cr-southface

In particular, this map, beautifully painted by the legendary [James Niehues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Niehues), is of the [**South Face**]{style="color: #FF8C42;"} of Big Sky, Montana.

But have you ever wondered how common south-facing slopes are?
In other words, do most ski trails in this hemisphere favor [**southern**]{style="color: #FF8C42;"} aspects, or are they more often found on the [**north**]{style="color: #36B37E;"} side of the mountain?

We began our journey to answer this question by gathering data from [OpenSkiMap](https://openskimap.org/), which refines [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) 
to create an amazing interactive visualization of the world and all its ski trails.

Thousands of OpenStreetMap contributors have worked for decades to annotate ski areas and their trails.<br><br>
In this New Hampshire/Vermont region, ...

Here is a local favorite, Whaleback Mountain.
[@cr-openskimap]{scale-by="3" pan-to="-90%, -85%"}


Analyzing this data, we could see how much *north-facing* each ski area is by looking at its "ski rose".
@cr-openskimap

Take, for example, Dartmouth Skiway in Lyme, NH.

These are the two signature sides of the Skiway, [**Holt's Ledge**]{style="color: #FF8C42;"} and [**Winslow Ledge**]{style="color: #36B37E;"}.

On powder days, from [**Winslow**]{style="color: #36B37E;"},
you can ski across the road and glide right to the bottom of [**Holt's**]{style="color: #FF8C42;"} Ledge Double.

If we:

- gather the coordinates for all trail segments,
- connect the dots,
- treat each of these segments as a [vector]{style="color: #f07178;"},
- scale the vectors by their [vertical drops]{style="color: #FFC857;"},

we can summarize them in a ...

<div style="--cr-narrative-sidebar-width: 3fr;">

... [**ski rose**]{style="color: #f07178;"}!<br><br>
Similar to how [wind roses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_rose) chart wind speed and direction at a location, ski roses characterize the directions of all trail segments at a ski area.

Each *spoke* of the circular chart represents a compass direction, with its length proportional to the [**total length**]{style="color: #FFC857;"} and [**vertical drop**]{style="color: #36B37E;"} of trail segments in that direction.<br><br>
Highlighted is the [**Northwest by West**]{style="color: #f07178;"} spoke...

And here's the [**North North East**]{style="color: #f07178;"} spoke.<br><br>
While these NNE segments may seem small, their verticals contribute to a significantly larger spoke in the rose compared to others.

Here are 48 more roses.
What do you think?
Do most of them look north-facing to you?

Our analysis of the slopes of *all* ski areas across the globe revealed a clear [poleward]{style="color: #36B37E;"} and slight [eastward]{style="color: #FFC857;"} bias.<br><br>
In other words, the majority of slopes in the [northern]{style="color: #36B37E;"} hemisphere oriented toward the [north]{style="color: #36B37E;"} and [east]{style="color: #FFC857;"},
while those in the [southern]{style="color: #36B37E;"} hemisphere are oriented toward the [south]{style="color: #36B37E;"} and [east]{style="color: #FFC857;"}.
[@cr-hemisphere]{scale-by="0.8"}

This trend likely reflects the desire to maximize [snow retention]{style="color: #36B37E;"} and minimize [sun exposure]{style="color: #FFC857;"}, ensuring better skiing conditions and longer seasons.

In addition to trail bearings, we have published data on other key metrics of a ski area like [**total verts**]{style="color: #FFC857;"}, [**number of lifts**]{style="color: #36B37E;"}, and [**peak elevations**]{style="color: #FF8C42;"} for ski areas across the world.

  title: Early Charts and the Origin of the Compass Rose

  issue: '04'
  abstract: <jats:p>Sailors as a class may fairly claim to have been the earliest technicians; they were the first, that is to say, to graduate from the stage of simple craftsmanship, involving only the use of tools and rules of thumb, to the employment of instruments and mathematics for solving their problems. For the nautical chart and magnetic compass are instruments of precision while sailing directions, if they are to be useful, must be couched in mathematical language. All these three aids to navigation go back at least seven hundred years, and an Italian ship inventory of 1294 has been quoted which included two charts, a pair of compasses and two lodestones with their accompaniments.</jats:p>

  title: Symbolism of Compass Roses on Early Modern Nautical Charts of the Adriatic Sea
  publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC
  issue: '1'
  abstract: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This qualitative analysis of symbolic elements in nautical cartography aims to provide an interdisciplinary insight into some aspects of early modern cartographic representations of the Adriatic Sea. The nautical charts were supplemented with compass roses, a graphic structure that facilitates orientation and correlates with rhumb lines. The research objective focusses primarily on the variety of signs for the cardinal directions north and east, additionally considering some rare but innovative and avant-garde pragmatic uses of compass roses to indicate magnetic declination. On the majority of the selected nautical charts, most of which were created in Mediterranean and Western European cultural centres, decorative elements such as the fleur-de-lis and the cross were used in compass roses to determine the cardinal points. The compass roses of these nautical charts often served as symbolic evidence of the social and economic belonging of the Adriatic to the European part of the Mediterranean geographical system, as well as to the Christian sphere of tradition and influence. The study has thus proved the existence of significant symbolic communication capacity of a compass rose, which was not only a utilitarian but also an artistic element.</jats:p>

  abstract: The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis released statistics today measuring the outdoor recreation economy for the nation, all 50 states, and the District of Columbia. The new U.S. data show that the value added of the outdoor recreation economy accounted for 2.3 percent ($639.5 billion) of current-dollar gross domestic product (GDP) for the nation in 2023 (national table 2). At the state level, value added for outdoor recreation as a share of state GDP ranged from 6.3 percent in Hawaii to 1.6 percent in Delaware, Connecticut, and New York.

  title: OSM Science—The Academic Study of the OpenStreetMap Project, Data, Contributors, Community, and Applications
  issue: '4'
  abstract: '<jats:p>This paper is an Editorial for the Special Issue titled “OpenStreetMap as a multidisciplinary nexus: perspectives, practices and procedures”. The Special Issue is largely based on the talks presented in the 2019 and 2020 editions of the Academic Track at the State of the Map conferences. As such, it represents the most pressing and relevant issues and topics considered by the academic community in relation to OpenStreetMap (OSM)—a global project and community aimed to create and maintain a free and editable database and map of the world. In this Editorial, we survey the papers included in the Special Issue, grouping them into three research perspectives: applications of OSM for studies within other disciplines, OSM data quality, and dynamics in OSM. This survey reveals that these perspectives, while being distinct, are also interrelated. This calls for the formalization of an ‘OSM science’ that will provide the conceptual grounds to advance the scientific study of OSM, not as a set of individualized efforts but as a unified approach.</jats:p>'

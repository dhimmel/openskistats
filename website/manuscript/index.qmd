## Abstract

We present OpenSkiStats, the first open, global, and continuously updating resource of downhill skiing summary statistics.
The initial focus of OpenSkiStats is to provide spatial statistics of ski areas and their runs, in particular, the orientation of ski runs.
Data is sourced from OpenSkiMap, a project to extract and visualize skiing related features from the crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap.
OpenSkiMap provides a resource of XX downhill ski areas in XX countries and XX downhill ski runs comprised of XX segments.

## Introduction

Analyses of city street orientation [@osmnx; @osmnx-joss; @street-orientation].

Compass roses are an ancient visualization steeped in tradition and symbolism.

**The eye of skiing**:
A 2-dimensional polar histogram showing skiable vert by orientation (angular coordinate) and absolute latitude (radial coordinate).
Orientations for ski run segments in the southern hemisphere undergo a hemispherical flip, such that a due west bearing remains due west, while a due south bearing becomes due north.
Hence, orientation axis labels use the terms poleward and equatorward.
Each 2D histogram bin's fill color represents enrichment of observed combined skiable vert over an equal distribution of orientation within an absolute latitude band.
Several processing steps help highlight the trends in the data:
latitude bands without at least XX in combined vert are removed;
a uniform prior is applied to orientations;
and extreme enrichment values are clipped.
Ski runs closer to the equator demonstrate a greater northeast preference.

**Skiable vert by latitude**:
The histogram shows the combined skiable vert across all ski run segments for each absolute latitude bin, split by hemisphere.
Downhill skiing is remarkably concentrated in both the northern hemisphere and around 45 degrees north!

Latitude insights of ski runs and their association with orientation.

Deduplication of effort: OpenStreetMap used by Strava, etc.
Single place to curate the world's ski areas

We extract all segments comprising ski runs

Orientation versus aspect

Aspect applies to polygons and lines.
Most polygon runs also have a line run Orientation only applies to lines In the absence of trees, aspect would be a better indicator of sun exposure.
However, with shading of trees, orientation could be a better indicator of sun exposure Weighting by vertical drop along a segment, likely brings orientation closer to aspect under the assumption that steeper trails are more likely to descend along the fall line.
Orientation was more readily available because it just requires the coordinates of the run (latitude, longitude, elevation), which OpenSkiMap includes, and does not require computation on adjacent terrain.
Ski trails that traverse the fall line are often graded, would the resolution of aspect measurements be sufficient Orientation might be more relevant for skiers ???

Weighting segments by vertical drop.
Downhill skiing is the art of descent.
On flat terrain, the is no terrain shading based on topography

Topographic shadowing versus vegetative shadowing

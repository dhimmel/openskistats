## Abstract

We present OpenSkiStats, the first open, global, and continuously updating resource of downhill skiing summary statistics.
The initial focus of OpenSkiStats is to provide spatial statistics of ski areas and their runs, in particular, the orientation of ski runs.
Data is sourced from OpenSkiMap, a project to extract and visualize skiing related features from the crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap.
OpenSkiMap provides a resource of XX downhill ski areas in XX countries and XX downhill ski runs comprised of XX segments.

## Introduction

There are an estimated 135 million alpine skiers worldwide, resulting in 350-380 million visits to ski areas per year [@vanat-2022].
Mountain tourism is estimated to drive up to 16% of international tourist arrivals worldwide (~375 million in 2019) [@unwto-mountain-tourism].
In the United States, outdoor recreation accounted for 2.3% of the gross domestic product in 2023 by adding $639.5 billion in value to the economy.
$3.9 billion directly [@bea-outdoor-rec]

In the United States, outdoor recreation generated $1.2 trillion in economic output or 2.3% of the gross domestic product in 2023  [@bea-outdoor-rec, Table 10].
$3.9 billion in value added is directly [@bea-outdoor-rec, Table 2]

Existing scholarly literature related to downhill skiing is limited and primarily focuses on economics [@futile-snowmaking], health impacts, avalanche science [@avalanche-risk-slabs], environmental sustainability [@ski-resort-sustainability; @apennines-winter; @dark-tourism], the threat from climate change [@climate-change-europe; @climate-change-alps; @climate-change-usnf; @climate-change-mountain-tourism; @climate-change-us-ski], or ski trail routing algorithms [@skivis; @osm-ski-routing].
We present one of the first scholarly accounts of the spatial metrics of ski areas on a global scale.

An open and global database and analysis of ski areas will help inform skiers, while providing insights to industry stakeholders.
There are a variety of existing resources that compile information of ski areas.
Both [OnTheSnow](https://www.onthesnow.com/) and [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/) contain a global database of ski areas and metrics,
with a focus on snow and weather conditions.
However, neither makes their source code or data openly available.
Stuart Winchester maintains several manually curated tables of ski areas,
which are discussed in articles on the [Storm Skiing Journal and Podcast](https://www.stormskiing.com/).
Laurent Vanat reports on aggregate ski areas metrics in his annual [_International Report on Snow & Mountain Tourism_](https://www.vanat.ch/ski-resorts-english).
Other resources focus on specific regions including
[New England Ski History](https://www.newenglandskihistory.com/),
Wikipedia's [Comparison of North American ski resorts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_North_American_ski_resorts),
and [Vertical Feet](https://verticalfeet.com/).
Other resources focus primarily on ski lifts,
including [Liftie](https://liftie.info/) ([open source](https://github.com/pirxpilot/liftie)) and [Lift Blog](https://liftblog.com/).
[Skimap.org](https://skimap.org/) compiles official trial maps produced by ski areas.

Here we base our analysis on OpenStreetMap and OpenSkiMap.

OpenStreetMap is a collaborative map of the world available under an open license.
Since its launch in 20024, geospatial data has been continuously contributed by a global community of volunteers and companies [@osm-haklay].
The platform's crowdsourced nature ensures frequent updates and granular detail,
with contributors adding information on features such as roads, buildings, natural landscapes, and, crucially for this study, ski areas and their trials and lifts.
Individual users often contribute to specific domains.
For example, study author Daniel Himmelstein previously helped complete and align the Long Trail, a long-distance hiking trail in Vermont [@osm-long-trail].
Meanwhile, the company Amazon [contributed](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Organised_Editing/Activities/Amazon) missing roads, driveways, and vehicle routing restrictions to aid in their delivery operations.
This mosaic of interests has resulted in an exceptionally broad and diverse collection of volunteered geographic information,
albeit with varying levels of detail by region.
This breadth along with OpenStreetMap's open license and availability have made it an invaluable tool for extracting and analyzing spatial data across a range of scientific disciplines [@osm-science].

OpenStreetMap provides its own general purpose [frontend](https://www.openstreetmap.org) to view a rendered maps of the world.
Specialized frontends have arisen to refine, analyze, and render maps for particular applications.
Examples include [OpenRailwayMap](https://www.openrailwaymap.org/) for railroads, [OpenCycleMap](https://www.opencyclemap.org/) for bicycling, [Waymarked Trails](https://hiking.waymarkedtrails.org/) for hiking routes, [OpenSeaMap](https://openseamap.org/) for seafaring and nautical pursuits, [Wheelmap](https://wheelmap.org/) for wheelchair accessibility, and [Open Infrastructure Map](https://openinframap.org) for electrical and telecommunication transmission.
[OpenSnowMap](https://opensnowmap.org) and [OpenSkiMap](https://openskimap.org) display both nordic and alpine skiing information.

[OpenSkiMap](https://openskimap.org) refines data from OpenStreetMap along with Skimap.org to create an interactive map of the world that highlights ski areas, runs, and lifts along with associated metadata like run difficulty.
OpenSkiMap is created and maintained by Russell Porter, with much of its code openly [available](https://github.com/russellporter/openskimap.org).
OpenSkiMap releases refined datasets of ski areas, runs, and lifts as GeoJSON downloads that update daily.
Since OpenStreetMap does not include granular elevation data,
OpenSkiMap incorporates the USGS Shuttle Radar Topography Mission [digital elevation data](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-digital-elevation-shuttle-radar-topography-mission-srtm-1).
<!-- TODO: cite specific SRTM identifier for the dataset used, perhaps https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PR7TFT -->

The founding motivation of this study was to examine trends in ski trail orientations.
The orientation of a ski trail is a major influencer of sunlight exposure.
On a local level, orientation affects weather patterns and climate, although in less generalizable ways than it does sunlight.
We were unable to find a systematic analysis of or database containing ski trial orientations.
In 2006, Alpine Zone Forum user Jonni [compiled](https://forums.alpinezone.com/threads/mountain-slopes-facing-side.11630/#post-126389 "Mountain Slopes-Facing Side. Alpine Zone Forum post by Jonni on 2006-12-03") a manual and qualitative list of the primary orientation for 37 ski areas in Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire.
Hence, we set out to create a global, continuously updating, open, and accessible resource for browsing ski areas and their orientations.

A second motivation was Geoff Boeing's analysis --- first by [blog](https://geoffboeing.com/2018/07/comparing-city-street-orientations/ "Comparing US City Street Orientations") and later publication [@street-orientation] --- of city street orientations from OpenStreetMap.
Boeing tabulated street segments by their orientation into polar histograms (i.e. roses) to show whether a city's roads were neatly arranged into a grid like Manhattan or a spaghetti mess like Boston.
Boeing released the modular code underlying his analysis in the osmnx Python package [@osmnx; @osmnx-joss],
which we use sometimes directly and other times as a reference.
Boeing's street roses take inspiration from wind roses, which summarize the direction of wind [@wind-rose-bias].
Wind roses themselves take inspiration from the compass rose,
an ancient visualization steeped in tradition and symbolism [@compass-rose; @compass-rose-symbolism].

## Data completeness

### Number of Ski Areas

OpenSkiMap contained {{< var openskimap.ski_areas.counts.01_raw >}} ski areas with {{< var openskimap.ski_areas.counts.02_downhill >}} of those assigned a downhill usage.

Laurent Vanat's _2022 International Report on Snow & Mountain Tourism_ compiled primarily national level data to report on global ski area metrics [@vanat-2022].
Vanat identified 5,764 ski areas worldwide,
when limiting to "equipped outdoor ski areas covered with snow", which excludes "indoor facilities, mountaineering-only areas, and other types of facilities such as dry slopes."
The 1,945 ski areas with 5 or more lifts qualified as a ski resort,
of which 52 were deemed as _major_ based on a threshold of "1 million skier visits per winter season".
OpenSkiMap contains 5,115 downhill ski areas with one or more lifts (i.e. equipped) and 1,635 with 5 or more lifts.
This equates to 89% and 84% of Vanat's respective counts.
<!-- should vanat comparables be filtered for operating?
TODO: country count: vanat identifies 68 countries
-->

Stuart Winchester identified 505 active ski areas in the United States as of 2023 [@storm-skiing-505-ski-areas].
Winchester required ski areas to have one or more lifts, a snow surface, operated for at least 1 day in the last season, excluding areas operating solely for personal use.
OpenSkiMap contains 510 operating downhill ski areas in the United States.
<!-- FIXME: operating filters: should just be operating or also null? -->

**The eye of skiing**:
A 2-dimensional polar histogram showing skiable vert by orientation (angular coordinate) and absolute latitude (radial coordinate).
Orientations for ski run segments in the southern hemisphere undergo a hemispherical flip, such that a due west bearing remains due west, while a due south bearing becomes due north.
Hence, orientation axis labels use the terms poleward and equatorward.
Each 2D histogram bin's fill color represents enrichment of observed combined skiable vert over an equal distribution of orientation within an absolute latitude band.
Several processing steps help highlight the trends in the data:
latitude bands without at least XX in combined vert are removed;
a uniform prior is applied to orientations;
and extreme enrichment values are clipped.
Ski runs closer to the equator demonstrate a greater northeast preference.

The histogram shows the combined skiable vert across all ski run segments for each absolute latitude bin, split by hemisphere.
Downhill skiing is remarkably concentrated in both the northern hemisphere and around 45 degrees north!

We extract all segments comprising ski runs

Orientation versus aspect

Aspect applies to polygons and lines.
Most polygon runs also have a line run Orientation only applies to lines In the absence of trees, aspect would be a better indicator of sun exposure.
However, with shading of trees, orientation could be a better indicator of sun exposure Weighting by vertical drop along a segment, likely brings orientation closer to aspect under the assumption that steeper trails are more likely to descend along the fall line.
Orientation was more readily available because it just requires the coordinates of the run (latitude, longitude, elevation), which OpenSkiMap includes, and does not require computation on adjacent terrain.
Ski trails that traverse the fall line are often graded, would the resolution of aspect measurements be sufficient Orientation might be more relevant for skiers ???

Weighting segments by vertical drop.
Downhill skiing is the art of descent.
On flat terrain, the is no terrain shading based on topography

Topographic shadowing versus vegetative shadowing

## Discussion

Warren Miller once said, "The best place in the world to ski is where you're skiing that day."
Miller's quote is a useful reprise against decision paralysis or a fear of missing out
by stressing that getting out and skiing somewhere along with a positive attitude are the necessary ingredients to a positive experience.
Yet, it is undeniable that conditions and logistics make a big impact on the experience.
Furthermore, each day skiing represents a large investment in terms of time and the cost of lift tickets, gear, and travel.
Accordingly, OpenSkiStats serves the large contingent of savvy skiers who seek exhaustive metrics into ski areas.
Such skiers meld observations on their own experiences with the data-driven insights provided by OpenSkiStats to create mental models on what factors of a ski area matter most to them and how these factors interact with conditions in search of the ultimate experience.
